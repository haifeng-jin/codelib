codelib
=======

This is my own code library for competitive programming.
The readability of the code is much better than most of the similar ones.
You can fork it if you would like to use it.


# Build

```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

# Test

Assume you have build the project and in the directory of `build/`.

```shell
ctest
```
